        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is a recipe for making empanadas the way my mother taught me.</p>
        <p>There are a million different ways to make these. Also, I never measure anything, so keep that in mind when I give measurements.</p>
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>1 package of ground beef (80-20) is fine</li>
            <li>1 can of tomato sauce</li>
            <li>Onion</li>
            <li>Garlic</li>
            <li>Culantro (also known as ngo gai (Vietnamese) or Pak Chee Farang (Thai))</li>
            <li>Adobo</li>
            <li>Sazon</li>
            <li>Bell Pepper (Red and Green)</li>
            <li>Discos</li>
            <li>Vegetable Oil for frying (I use Canola)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Put the onion, peppers, garlic and culantro in a blender/food processor until you get sofrito. Put any extra in the freezer.</li>
            <li>Heat some oil in a pan and then saute the sofrito.</li>
            <li>Once it's a nice, deep green color, add your ground beef. Add the adobo and sazon. Brown it.</li>
            <li>Once it's browned, add the tomato sauce. Shouldn't add so much so that it's soupy, but you want a kinda sloppy joe consistency.</li>
            <li>Once the picadillo's done, make sure your discos are unthawed.</li>
            <li>Add some frying oil to a pan; heat it up.</li>
            <li>Add some picadillo to the center of the disco. Fold it and crimp with a fork.</li>
            <li>Fry the discos.</li>
        </ol>
